            <p>
            When you want to clear any exam then you must have knowledge about what‚Äôs the pattern of the examination. First, know what UPSC wants from you or what type of person they appoint in the commission.
            <b><i>‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt cross the sea merely by standing and staring at the water ‚Äú</i></b>
            Simply if you want to crack this exam then first think like an officer & when you develop these qualities then definitely, you will clear this examination. Make your goals, make a schedule, do some exercise or meditation then read a lot because the syllabus of UPSC is very massive you must have knowledge of everything what‚Äôs happening around your country & world similarly.
            To clear UPSC you have to do smart & hard work both because the commission also wants from the aspirants that their future officers are smart & determined for their work.
            Now I am going to tell you what is the pattern & syllabus of CSE.So basically the Civil Service Examination pattern divided into three stages</p>
           <ol>                 
            <li><h3>Preliminary Examination</h3>
            The preliminary exam consists of two objective type papers for a total of 400 marks & each paper has 100 multiple types of questions (200 marks for each paper).
            However preliminary examination is just a screening test for candidates both papers are qualifying in nature & their marks, not going to effect your final marks. This examination is all about checking your basic awareness only. There will be negative marking of one-third marks for wrong answers marked by a candidate & the medium of the question paper in both English and Hindi.
